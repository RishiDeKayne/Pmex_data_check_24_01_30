#vcf stored in: /data/kelley/projects/pmex/capture/combined.vcf.gz

#Pi, theta, fst, PCA of Puya parental populations (have vcf file)
#How much N/S - partitioning across samples, how many fixed differences
#First dataset to do this with is vcf
#The other is wild transcriptomes - more genome-wide (but transcriptome) - no data for differentially expressed regions (2016 Kelley MBE)
#ACTION ITEMS
#Download and map transcriptomes to pmex genome (whichever kara used)
#Partition VCF
#Look at PCA differences
